# Deep Learning Models for IDS with the NSL-KDD dataset


This work is inspired to the paper "Intrusion Detection System for NSL-KDD Dataset Using
Convolutional Neural Networks", DING Yalei and ZHAI Yuqingof, of 2018 2nd International
Conference on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, which deals with the  reproduction of deep learning models on the NSL-KDD dataset. The task is a classification of network attacks, based on network traffic informations.
